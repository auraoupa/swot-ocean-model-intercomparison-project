# Ocean model requirements

To participate in this project, we are requesting the following conditions for the simulations:

+ A minimum domain dimension of 10°x10° is required.
+ A minimum horizontal resolution of 0.5° is required. 
<!--should we specified a "effective resolution".-->
+ A minimum temporal output of 5-day is required.
+ A minimum temporal dimension of 1-year is required.
    + However, a long time period would be ideal. If you want to submit more than one year's data, please send us one metadata and dataset per yearn as explained in the instructions document.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> 1) We are accepting not only models physics but also emulators and re-analysis dataset.
> 2) We are accepting any convention for sea surface height output
